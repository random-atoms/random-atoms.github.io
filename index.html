  <p>Trying to build and run llama.cpp on my old Xubuntu laptop. 
    Started with installing gh cli, but didn't use it. 
    Directly cloned llama.cpp from github using https.
    Got cmake installed, built llama.cpp, but failed to run DeepSeek model directly from HuggingFace 
    because libcurl wasn't part of the build. Rebuilt after installing libcurl4-openssl-dev using sudo.
    Needs to be compiled with the -DLLAMA_CURL=ON flag on for this to work.
